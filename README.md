# Project Title


Our web-based application is designed to streamline the monitoring and management of financial and physical progress certificates for research projects. It supports the classification of projects into S&T (MoC-funded) and R&D (CIL-funded) types.

## Key features include:

* Admin Console for CMPDI to oversee project creation, updates, and final status, with automated form generation and submission.

* Research Investigator Console allowing PIs to submit quarterly reports, fund utilization details, and requests for time extensions or additional funds, via secure login.

* Automated Data Entry with centralized database storage for audit purposes, reducing manual errors in handling over 1000 fields of data.

* Document Management with seamless file uploads, version control, and activity-based tracking through charts.

* The system ensures secure, role-based access, real-time progress tracking, and efficient oversight from project inception to completion.
